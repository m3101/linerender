For all calculations, the coordinate system used is the same as
depicted in Hartley & Zisserman's "Multiple View Geometry".
Row notation was used for matrices (row = vector) for simpler integration
with Numpy.
"""

"""
These methods are not at all optimised and were developed without
using direct references as an attempt to build a renderer fully from
memory and consolidating that knowledge, so there are bits (the rotations
in the camera constructor, for example) where redundant and unnecessary steps
are separated as a way to make it easier to think visually about
what's going on (which for me is the only way to do this at all :p)
